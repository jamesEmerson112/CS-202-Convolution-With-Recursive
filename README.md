### An Thien Vo, CS 202 - 1001

This program will use a recursive function named
"double convo(double \*p, double \*q, int n)", \*p, \*q are dynamic arrays both of dimensions n, to find the convolution of the two dynamic arrays. Write both a c-like program, and C++ program with a destructor, and a constructor

```
Formula: Sigma of n starting from 0 as the sum of two dynamic arrays
q[i]p[i]
